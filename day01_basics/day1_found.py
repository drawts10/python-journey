#  Core Concepts (read carefully)

# Variables
age = 26
name = "Mike"
is_student = True


# Part of Rules:

# A variable should not be identified with one letter
x = 26

# A variable a name that clearly indicates its intended use 
user_age = 26


# Data Types
int      # 26
float    # 26.5
str      # "Mike"
bool     # True / False


# Check types:

type(age)

# Basic Operations
total = 10 + 5
average = total / 2
full_name = name + " Smith"

# Printing Like a Developer
print("User name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Is student:", is_student)
